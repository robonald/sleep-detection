# Sleep Detection Project

## Overview

The Sleep Detection Project is a Python application that utilizes the OpenCV library to monitor and analyze sleep patterns. The project focuses on detecting facial landmarks and tracking eye movements to infer the user's sleep status. By employing computer vision techniques, it aims to provide insights into sleep quality and duration.

## Features

- **Facial Landmark Detection:** Utilizing OpenCV's facial landmark detection, the application identifies key points on the face, including eyes, nose, and mouth.

- **Eye Tracking:** Monitoring the movement of the eyes allows the system to infer whether the user's eyes are open or closed, contributing to the sleep detection mechanism.

- **Real-time Analysis:** The application provides real-time feedback on the user's sleep status, allowing for immediate insights and intervention if necessary.

- **Customizable Parameters:** Users can adjust parameters such as sensitivity and tracking thresholds to optimize the system for different environments and conditions.

## Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the Sleep Detection Project:

- Python (3.x recommended)
- OpenCV
- NumPy

Install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sleep-detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd sleep-detection
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python sleep_detection.py
   ```

   The application will use your computer's webcam to monitor and analyze your sleep status.

## Customization

Adjust the parameters in the `sleep_detection.py` file to fine-tune the application according to your preferences and environmental conditions.

```python
# Adjustable parameters
SENSITIVITY_THRESHOLD = 0.25
TRACKING_THRESHOLD = 30
```
